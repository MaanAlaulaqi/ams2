Absence check for the day ideas:

- Use the Absence_presence table in the DB to put "ticks" on each employee/student.
	• The ticks will coincide with the classes as well, so we'll need a column for "Class_id"
	• We'll use the ClassCheck() method to obtain the class_id? 
	• Push in the class_id with the student_id and mark the ticks. 
	• Here's how the interaction should be:
		* The student/employee will swipe their card.
		* AMS will first check if student of instructor.
		* If instructor, a tick will be assigned and things will proceed as they should for the instructor's perspective. 
		* If student, same same. 
		* Where it matters, however, is if they swipe again within the same class time, all things will remain the same, however the presence will not be noted, as their will already be a tick on their profile.
	• At a time before midnight, the absences/presence will be tranferred to a more permanent table and:
	• At midnight have the ticks reset.
	
Since there are an average of 31 classes per semester for each course, the absence percentage will be calculated as (# of no_ticks of personel)/31*100.
