	• At attendance list for the instructor 
		- Write a method that'll pull out whether the instructor was present today and then use the result to either automatically activate the AMS.
	• Allow the MarkPresence() to work better
		- Fix your fucking code you noob. 
	• Maybe make another methof that activate the presence of the AMS? Somethihng where the 15 min thing can be utilized.
	• Walla madri


YOOO -- 
Ok quick idea before you forget, 
FifteenMinActivate method:
	• This can use the InstructorPresence() method, where the method sets a boolean true 
	• That boolean is reset at the end of a class, somehow
		- Maybe the thread can have a function that checks the class_array and once a new class starts the boolean is reset? 
		- I feel like there may be some potential errors here.. 
		- But as far as tracing and logic goes, this will work fine. The 15 min activation won't activate unless the boolean is false. 
		- I feel burnt out of existence 
	• idk but ya
