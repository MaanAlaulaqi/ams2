TO DO 
- Figure out the Foreign key shenanigans 
- Database class diagram? idk, but you need to figure out the relationships between the tables (ie, student to classes is 1-to-many)
- Start using the reader to pull up data from the database 
- Write the rest of the methods and classes
- Clean shit up
- Create documentation
- Create/Edit report
- Submit
- Create a pretty UI so people think it's a pro project. It's hard to convey the work that went into this, but that's always 
been the case for projects like these. You can't just "demand" for a feature to be added to a new phone, the devs and engineers need
to go through a bunch of legal loopholes before they can even begin to look at that stuff. Anyways. Project -> PRETTY. Thank
