Attendance Management System 
Hello! 

This is kind of a messy repo, but also kind of straight forward. Go through the src folders to find the lovely bits you want
There are extra files in there that I wanted to keep a track of, like the ACR manual (USB card scanner)

But ya, this is mostly for my capstone project. 

The REALLY basic idea of it: A one stop swipe-and-go, where when a student swipes, their attendance is registered. 
For kicks and giggles, I'll try and add a "Add Class" and "Export Student List" feature, but its real life functionality won't be 
very well thought out, since the idea here is to have a small machine running this code in different classrooms. This isn't a 
user intensive application. It's more of an interface with limited functions. 

I'll try and keep this updated.
